## Increase you productivity by using VS Code Snippets

An average human spends more than 82 days brushing their teeth in their lifetime. That’s 4-5 minutes that you could have spent lazing in your bed daily if you could automate it.

Alas, we have not automated it as of yet...

But what we can automate is the writing repeating patterns in our code with VS Code snippets. Let’s see what I am talking about with an example.

Before I knew about the snippets, I used to write the boilerplate code of each React component from scratch in every file. I didn’t do it for fun, I did it because I didn’t know any better.

Let’s turn over a new leaf by creating a snippet that generates the boilerplate code for a React component. What we hope to achieve is shown below:

### **Here is how to do it step by step:**

1- On the top left of your VS Code window click on **File** (**Code** on macOS). Then click on **Preferences** and select **User Snippets**.

2- After you click on the **User Snippets** you will be prompted to select a language you are writing this snippet for. Choosing **JavaScript React** will open a file named **`javascriptreact.json`**. This file will contain all the snippets that will be available to us in a JSX file.

3- Paste the following in `javascriptreact.json` file and hit save.

```json
{
  "React Functional Component": {
    "prefix": ["rfc"],
    "body": [
      "import React from \"react\"",
      "const Index = () => {",
      "\treturn (",
      "\t\t<></>",
      "\t)",
      "}",
      "export default Index"
    ],
    "description": "Creates a react functional component"
  }
}
```

Now, you can see this snippet in the IntelliSense whenever you type this the prefix `rfc` and use it in any JSX file to create the boilerplate for the React component.

If you still can’t see the snippet, then it might be because of the VS Code editor settings that prevent you from seeing snippet suggestions.

You can enable them in **File > Preferences > Settings > Editor >Suggest > Show Snippets**

Now, let’s see what’s happening in the code block that we wrote in `javascriptreact.json`

This file has an object with a key-value pair that represents a single snippet. The key is the name of the snippet and the value is an object with `prefix`, `body`, and `description`(optional) properties.

We can create as many of these key-value pairs/snippets as we want in this file, given that they follow the above-mentioned schema.

The `prefix` property represents one or more words, by typing which, we can see the snippet in the IntelliSense. The value of the prefix property can be a string containing the trigger word or an array containing multiple trigger words.

The `body` property has the actual code that will be written by the snippet. Each element in the array represents a single line of code. The `\t` you see in the above code is an escape sequence to insert tabs for better formatting of the code. You can also write all the code in a single string and add new lines by using `\n` escape sequence but I prefer the array approach because of the readability factor.

`description` is an optional property that displays the description of the snippet in the IntelliSense.

This is not all we can do with snippets. As you can see, I have hard-coded the name of the component as `Index`. Some people prefer to use the file name as the name of their React component. It would be a nuisance to change the name of the component every time you create it through a snippet.

We can fix this problem by replacing the `Index` with `$TM_FILENAME_BASE`, which is one of the predefined variables available to us, to extend the functionality of our snippets in VS Code. What this variable does is that it gives us the filename of the current document without its extensions.

Now, whenever we use this snippet, the component name will be replaced with the filename.

**Note: We can use these variables only in the body of the snippet**

You can find out more about these variables and what we can do with them [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).

Another important concept that you should be aware of, to get the most out of the snippets is that of the placeholders.
